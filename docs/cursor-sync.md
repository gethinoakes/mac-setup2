Cursor IDE does not offer built-in support for syncing settings, keybindings, and extensions across different user accounts or devices. However, you can achieve synchronization on your Mac by manually linking the relevant configuration directories between user accounts. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Identify Cursor's Configuration Directories:**

Cursor stores its settings and extensions in the following locations:

- **Settings and Keybindings:**
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User`
- **Extensions:**
  - `~/.cursor`

**2. Set Up a Shared Directory:**

Create a directory accessible to both user accounts. For instance, you can create a shared folder in `/Users/Shared/CursorConfig`:

```bash
sudo mkdir /Users/Shared/CursorConfig
sudo chmod 777 /Users/Shared/CursorConfig
```



**3. Move Existing Configuration to the Shared Directory:**

For each user account, move the existing Cursor configuration into the shared directory:

```bash
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User /Users/Shared/CursorConfig/User
mv ~/.cursor /Users/Shared/CursorConfig/.cursor
```



**4. Create Symbolic Links:**

After moving the directories, create symbolic links from the original locations to the shared directory:

```bash
ln -s /Users/Shared/CursorConfig/User ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User
ln -s /Users/Shared/CursorConfig/.cursor ~/.cursor
```



Repeat these steps for each user account to ensure all accounts are linked to the shared configuration.

**5. Automate the Process with a Script (Optional):**

To streamline the setup for multiple accounts, consider creating a shell script that automates the moving and linking process.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Permissions:** Ensure that the shared directory and its contents have appropriate permissions to allow read and write access for all relevant user accounts.
- **Conflicts:** Be cautious when multiple users are using Cursor simultaneously, as concurrent writes to the same configuration files may lead to conflicts.

By following these steps, you can effectively synchronize your Cursor IDE settings, keybindings, and extensions across different user accounts on your Mac.
