# Always Use Gum for CLI Functionality

- All CLI interactions must use Gum (https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) [gum.md](mdc:docs/gum.md) for:
  - User prompts and confirmations
  - Spinners and progress indicators
  - Styled text output
  - Input validation
  - Menu selections
- Fallback to traditional methods only when Gum is not available
- Use Gum's styling capabilities for consistent, polished UI
- Prefer Gum's interactive components over static text
- Ensure Gum usage follows the project's existing patterns
