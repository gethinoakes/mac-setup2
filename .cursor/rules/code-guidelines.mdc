## General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code, documentation, and comments.
- Prioritize modular, reusable, and scalable code.
- Prioritize readable and easy to understand code over shorter code.
- Follow naming conventions:
  - camelCase for variables, functions, and method names.
  - PascalCase for class names.
  - snake_case for file names and directory structures.
  - UPPER_CASE for environment variables.
- Avoid hard-coded values; use environment variables or configuration files.

### Bash Scripting

- Use descriptive names for scripts and variables (e.g., `backup_files.sh` or `log_rotation`).
- Write modular scripts with functions to enhance readability and reuse.
- Include comments for each major section or function.
- Avoid hardcoding; use environment variables or parameterized inputs.
- Use `shellcheck` to lint scripts and improve quality.
- Use `trap` for error handling and cleaning up temporary files.

### Testing and Documentation

- Document solutions thoroughly in markdown.
